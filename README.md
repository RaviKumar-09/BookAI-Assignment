## Task Overview

This repository contains my submission for the Front-End Development Internship assignment at BookAI. The task was to replicate a feature or component from the website [TryBookAI.com]


## Key Features

- **Design Fidelity**: The replicated component mirrors the original design in both appearance and functionality, ensuring a seamless user experience.
  
- **Responsive Design**: The component is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
  

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structuring and styling the component.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity.
- **Custom CSS**: Used to style the component.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RaviKumar-09/BookAI-Assignment.git

   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser, or visit the [landing page](https://ravikumar-09.github.io/BookAI-Assignment/) directly.

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of the replicated component [here](https://ravikumar-09.github.io/BookAI-Assignment/).

## Evaluation Criteria
